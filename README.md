# Computer vision - Python implementation

In this project, I've implemented some basic concept in Image Processing and Computer Vision (almost machine learning)

## Basic concepts

### Load video
- [x] Load video from camera (video/load_video_from_camera.py)
- [ ] Load video from file

### Gray Scaling
- [x] RBG to Gray (grayscaling/grayscaling.py)
- [x] Intensive transformation (grayscaling/intensive_transformation.py)
- [x] Gamma correction (grayscaling/gamma_correction.py)
- [x] Contrast stretching (grayscaling/contrast_schetching.py)
- [x] Power law (grayscaling/power_law.py)

### Arithmetic operations
- [x] Addition (arithmetics/basic_arithmetics.py)
- [x] Subtraction (arithmetics/basic_arithmetics.py)
- [x] Multiple(arithmetics/basic_arithmetics.py)
- [x] Division(arithmetics/basic_arithmetics.py)

### Histogram
- [x] Visualize histogram chart (histogram/plot_histogram.py)
- [x] Histogram equalization (gray image, RGB image) (histogram/equalization.py)
- [ ] Histogram matching (Histogram specialization)

### Image segmentation
- [x] Sobel mask to detect edge (segmentation/sobel.py)
- [x] Canny edge detection (segmentation/canny.py)
- [x] Basic global thresholding (segmentation/thresholding/basic_global_thresholding.py)
- [x] Otsu thresholding (segmentation/thresholding/outsu.py)
- [x] Medium, min, max filtering (spatial/filtering.py)

### Geometric
- [x] Scaling image by Nearest Neighbor approach (geometrix/scaling.py)
- [x] Transforming image (geometrix/transform.py)
- [x] Rotate image (geometrix/rotate.py)

## Mini projects
- [x] Sketch: detect edges from camera (miniproject/sketch.py)


## TODO
- [ ] Refactor code from function to class
